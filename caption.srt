00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:01,629
Late one foggy evening,

2
00:00:02,039 --> 00:00:04,389
Sam found himself wandering the woods,

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:06,760
drawn to the sound of faint music.

4
00:00:07,409 --> 00:00:08,470
The deeper he went,

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,739
the louder it grew,

6
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:11,500
echoing through the trees.

7
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,939
He stumbled upon an old forgotten well,

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,379
and as he approached,

9
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,770
the music stopped,

10
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,010
replaced by soft whispers.

11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,110
Leaning over the edge,

12
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,959
he saw nothing but darkness.

13
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,479
Suddenly,

14
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,940
a pale hand gripped his shoulder,

15
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,020
and before he could scream,

16
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:32,668
he was pulled into the shadowy depths.

17
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:34,430
The forest

18
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,630
fell silent.
