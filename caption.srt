00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:01,539
Late one foggy evening,

2
00:00:01,769 --> 00:00:06,710
Sam found himself wandering the woods drawn to the sound of faint music.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,460
The deeper he went,

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,489
the louder it grew, echoing through the trees,

5
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:14,890
he stumbled upon an old forgotten well,

6
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:16,409
and as he approached,

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,010
the music stopped, replaced by soft whispers

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,909
leaning over the edge,

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,950
he saw nothing but darkness.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,430
Suddenly

11
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:27,920
a pale hand gripped his shoulder

12
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,860
and before he could scream,

13
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:32,659
he was pulled into the shadowy depths,

14
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,610
the forest fell silent.
